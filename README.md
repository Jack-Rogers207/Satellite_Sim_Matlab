# Read Me for Satellite orbit simulation 
Satellite orbit simulation allows the user to change a satellites orbit between a polar, low Earth, and hyperbolic orbit.

## How to Use
1. Open ‘rogers_jack_project.mlx’ in MATLAB. 
2. Run the script 
3. Select an orbit type when prompted (press 1, 2, or 3)
4. Self-destruct the satellite when prompted (press 4)


## Attribution 
The EarthTopography.jpg file was adapted and modified from a NASA source. The file was renamed and adjusted for this project. NASA's code is public domain and was used as a base reference. 

### Bugs and updates
#### [0.1.3] - 2025.04.24
Created 3D model of Earth with topography map, provided by a NASA source, wrapped around sphere.
#### [0.2.0] - 2025.04.30
Added satellite orbital parameters with GUI user input functions that allow user to change orbit or self-destruct satellite. Two different outputs produced: 3D model and orbit path. 
#### [0.2.1] - 2025.05.01
Combined two output using hold functions for one correct output. 
### [0.2.2] - 2025.05.07
Corrected parameters for both hyperbolic and polar orbits. 
### [0.2.3] - 2025.08.30
Changed Hyperbolic Orbit to Gravity Assist
